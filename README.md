## How to use
The light/dark mode is controlled by `--bs-canvas-filter`. You can set `--bs-canvas-filter` to `filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)` in dark mode.

Internal styles are adjusted to fit [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) styles. There is a variable `IgvCss` if you want to modify them.
